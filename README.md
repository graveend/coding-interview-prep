# Coding interview prep

This is a collection of coding challenges that I've solved, in preparation for coding interviews.

[HelloWorld.java](src/HelloWorld.java) and [HelloWorld.kt](src/HelloWorld.kt) are good templates to use.

## Setup

- In [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), File -> New -> Project from existing sources
- Import project from external model -> Gradle

You should now be able to add Java or Kotlin files and run individual tests using the editor.
