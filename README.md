# Coding interview prep

This is a collection of coding challenges that I've solved, in preparation for coding interviews.

[HelloWorld.java](src/HelloWorld.java) and [HelloWorld.kt](src/HelloWorld.kt) are good templates to use.

## Setup

- In [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), File -> New -> Project from existing sources
- Import project from external model -> Gradle

You should now be able to add Java or Kotlin files and run individual tests using the editor.

I focus on Java/Kotlin in this repo. For a Python/Go approach,

Questions
1. [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
2. [ContainerWithMostWater](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)
3. [TrappingRainWater](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/) [IMP]


How to solve?
1. Verify the input constraints
    - Check for positive and negative values?
    - Dupilicate numbers?
    - Will there always be a solution available?
    - Can there be multiple solutions to this question?
    
2. Write out some test cases
